# StudentManagement
# A web2.0 project which focuses on building student portal.

It is a college WebDevelopment Project which solves the issues faced by the College Portal.

# Problem being solved.
Our college portal was not having a method to autocheck if the fees are paid or not and a methos to display result if the fees are paid or else redirect to
the fee payment site and send a message that your fees is pending. Due to which we have to go through a long procedure of e-mails to get the result.
So our project tries to eliminate this issue by displaying the result if the student has paid the fees and otherwise redirect him to the fee payment site and
send a message that your fees is pending and once the fees is paid, he will be able to see his result.
